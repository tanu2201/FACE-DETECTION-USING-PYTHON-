# FACE-DETECTION-USING-PYTHON
👤 Real-Time Face Recognition System using OpenCV & Dlib
A Python-based real-time face detection and recognition project that accurately distinguishes between two specific individuals using machine learning techniques.

🔍 Features:
Captured and processed 500+ images per person to build a robust face dataset

Extracted face embeddings and saved them in a .npy file for efficient retrieval

Implemented using OpenCV, Dlib, and face_recognition library

Enabled real-time face recognition through webcam input

Applied HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) for face detection and deep learning embeddings for identification

💡 Use Case:
Designed to simulate a basic AI agent that recognizes individuals in real-time — ideal for building access systems, attendance tools, or surveillance monitoring.
